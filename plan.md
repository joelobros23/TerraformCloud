# Project Plan: TerraformCloud

**Description:** A simplified web hosting platform providing basic domain management and user authentication.


## Development Goals

- [ ] Configure tailwindcss-rails gem by running `rails tailwindcss:install` and modify application.tailwind.css to include custom styles.
- [ ] Add model validations for the Domain model (name, plan, status) in app/models/domain.rb.
- [ ] Customize the views generated by the domain scaffold using Tailwind CSS classes for improved UI/UX (app/views/domains).
- [ ] Modify the Domains controller (app/controllers/domains_controller.rb) to associate each new domain with the currently logged-in user during creation.
- [ ] Implement authorization using `before_action :authenticate_user!` in the Domains controller to protect domain management functionalities.
- [ ] Display a list of the current user's domains on their profile/dashboard (create a dashboard view and a route for it).
- [ ] Add a 'price' attribute to the 'plan' field in the Domain model, and modify the form to display this information.
- [ ] Ensure that domain creation/editing is only allowed for the domain's owner (add authorization logic).
- [ ] Improve the Domain model and scaffolding to include better status options (e.g., 'active', 'pending', 'suspended').  Make these enum fields.
